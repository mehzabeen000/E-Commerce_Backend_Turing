In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS from the swagger(https://backendapi.turing.com/docs/#/).I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify if the customer is valid or not. We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.
